## Prerequisites 

This guide is intended for Mattermost System Admins setting up the Nagios plugin and Mattermost users who want information about the plugin functionality.

If you are a Nagios admin/user and think there is something this plugin lacks or something that it does could be done another way, let us know! We are trying to develop this plugin based on users' needs. If there is a certain feature you or your team needs, open up an issue, and explain your needs. We will be happy to help.
